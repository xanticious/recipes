# KNHANES meal ideas

Frequency-ranked **plates**, not recipes. A plate is everything one adult
would typically eat at one time on one recall day, for example:

`toast, eggs, tea`

These lists are **inspiration for a later Meal Ideas catalog page**: a full
dinner in mind, with optional links out to recipes for the parts. They are
**not a live catalog import** and were not scored as NHANES sitting counts.

## Survey

- **Survey:** Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES)
- **Years:** Annual rolling survey; published nutrition tables from recent cycles (e.g. 2019–2022) were used as context
- **What was located:** Microdata requires registration with KDCA. This pass did not register or parse files. Plates follow published Korean diet patterns plus typical home meals: rice with soup and banchan, kimchi stew, bibimbap, kimbap, ramyeon, tteokbokki, barley tea.
- **Microdata parsed:** No. Registered microdata was not parsed. Lists are qualitative.

## How the lists were built

Filters analogous to the NHANES meal-idea pass:

- Adults (analogous to NHANES 18+)
- Home-eaten everyday fare, not restaurant tasting menus
- Grocery / home-store foods rather than eat-out as the default
- Lunch and dinner are mixed plates, not dessert-only or drink-only
- Baby foods omitted
- Drinks that belong with a meal stay on that plate; drink-only sittings go in drinks.md

Published food-group results and typical home eating occasions fill the
plate lists. Occasion mapping follows the same buckets as NHANES:
breakfasts, lunches, dinners, drinks, snacks, desserts, and other
(unnamed, leftover, or odd-hour sittings).

Drinks that belong with a meal stay on that plate. Standalone drink
sittings go in drinks.md. Water kinds are treated as one drink;
plain milks, regular/diet soda, and similar yogurts are stacked.

## Preparation variants

The same groceries can be different meals: leftover rice as gukbap, kimchi fried rice, bibimbap, or kimbap; eggs in stew, as a rolled omelette, or on ramyeon; leftover stew as breakfast soup versus a full rice-and-banchan dinner.

The same groceries can be several meals. Do not collapse those into one
catalog row when the eating occasion feels different.

## Regenerate

```
C:\Users\tonyl\Downloads\nhanes-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/write-regional-analyses.py
```

Requires pandas and openpyxl only for the EFSA table. Other folders are
curated markdown and write even if that parse fails.
